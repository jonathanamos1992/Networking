#Local Port Forwarding

ssh -p <optional alt port> <user>@<server ip> -L <local bind port>:<tgt ip>:<tgt port>
-p <optional alt port>

-L whatever port where trying to open on our machine
-

Local Port Forward to remote target via server
ssh student@172.16.1.15 -L 2222:172.16.40.10:22
-<student on .10>

Have to use -NT becuse it can alter commands and break your tunnel by putting you somewhere you don't want to be by interacting with your tunnel.

#Dynamic Port
-Needed to run tools such as proxy chains to be able to enumerate a machine
-When finished enumerating a host, change from proxy chains because you can only have one dynamic port open at a time.
ssh T1user@T1 -p 1111 -D 9050 -NT


Then changes to ssh T1user@T1 -p 1111 -L 2222:T2:22 -NT

Protocols that use multiple ports:
FTP uses proxychains

#Remote Port Forward
-Changes perspective when running commands

-When running scans, if you see that port 22 is blocked but telnet is open, use Telnet
Find out which ports are open and what is on the ports
If using a different port to connect, must use -p and specify port.

When getting on a new device, enumerate and get situational awareness of where you are
