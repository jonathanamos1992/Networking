Local Port Forwarding

ssh -p <optional alt port> <user>@<server ip> -L <local bind port>:<tgt ip>:<tgt port>
-p <optional alt port>

-L whatever port where trying to open on our machine
-

Local Port Forward to remote target via server
ssh student@172.16.1.15 -L 2222:172.16.40.10:22
-<student on .10>

Have to use -NT becuse it can alter commands and break your tunnel by putting you somewhere you don't want to be by interacting with your tunnel.

Dynamic Port

ssh T1user@T1 -p 1111 -D 9050 -NT


Then changes to ssh T1user@T1 -p 1111 -L 2222:T2:22 -NT

Protocols that use multiple ports:
FTP uses proxychains

Remote Port Forward
-Changes perspective when running commands

-When running scans, if you see that port 22 is blocked but telnet is open, use Telnet
Find out which ports are open and what is on the ports

When getting on a new device, enumerate and get situational awareness of where you are
